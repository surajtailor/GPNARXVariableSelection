%% Most important scripts
% In all of these scripts toggle the switches in the main code and not within the sub scripts them selves.

% working
case - mainscript - no repoptimsation one time variable selection
caseOptimise - optMainScript - reoptimisation one time variable selection 
caseRep - repMainScript - reoptimisation recurrent variable selection

% not working/ dont know
caseReverse - revMainScript - performs the one time variable selsection backwards removing most relevant variables.

%% Test results
% everthing outside of the results archive is useful

%% Future work
% Simplify functions to take one variable and unpack things. caseRep is extremely cluttered. caseOptimise is less. case is even less. 

%% Archive
% Useless junk. It has the first GPNARX code that I used.
